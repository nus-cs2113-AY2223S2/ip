## Features

### Adding a task `todo`

The ```todo``` command allows you to add in tasks that do not have a deadline or duration.

Format: ```todo [TASK_NAME]```

Example:
```
todo sleep
```

### Adding a task ```deadline```

The `deadline` command allows you to add in tasks that have a specific deadline. Separate the `[TASK_NAME]` and `[DEADLINE]` with a `/`.

Format: `deadline [TASK_NAME] /[DEADLINE]`

Example:
```
deadline sleep /by 10pm
```

### Adding a task ```event```

The `event` command allows you to add in tasks that occurs within a period of time. Separate the `[TASK_NAME]`,`[FROM]` and `[TO]` with `/`.

Format: `event [TASK_NAME] /[FROM] /[TO]`

Example:
```
event sleep /from 10pm /to 8am
```

### Deleting a task ```delete```

The `delete` command allows you to delete any current task specified by `[INDEX]` in the list.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

Example:
```
delete 1
``` 
will remove task *sleep* from the list.

*Note: `delete` command could not be undo once called.*

### Marking a task as done ```mark```

The `mark` command allows you to mark any task specified by the`[INDEX]` as done. Marking the task as done does not delete the task from the list.

Format: `mark [INDEX]`

Example:
```
mark 1
``` 
will mark task *sleep* as done, indicated by `[x]`.

### unmarking a task as done ```unmark```

The `unmark` command allows you to unmark any previously marked task. The task to be unmarked is specified by the`[INDEX]`.

Format: `unmark [INDEX]`

Example:
```
unmark 1
``` 
will unmark task *sleep*, indicated by `[ ]`.

### Finding tasks ```find```

The `find` command allows you to find any tasks containing the substring `[NAME]`. It will return a list of tasks containing `[NAME]`.

Format: `find [NAME]`

Example:
```

``` 
or
```
find lee
```

will return task *sleep*.

### Displaying all tasks ```list```
