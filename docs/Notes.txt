This file is for personal use, and should not be used for grading purposes.

Savefile format:
for todos: t|NAME|IS_DONE
for deadlines: d|NAME|BY|IS_DONE
for events: e|NAME|FROM|TO|IS_DONE

delimiter is |, if it is not obvious enough
there is probably no need for keywords, since the delimiter should be good enough
to act as replacement for keywords. But screw whoever who ever decides to put | as 
part of their arguments.


Yay parsing done, now left with saving into the file. File corruption not handled, 
so if stupid shit like ||||||| got entered into the savefile, I am screwed. Will 
finish up saving into the savefile tomorrow. Should really find a time to refactor 
certain methods into other classes.
