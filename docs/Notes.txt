This file is for personal use, and should not be used for grading purposes.

Savefile format:
for todos: T|NAME|IS_DONE
for deadlines: D|NAME|BY|IS_DONE
for events: E|NAME|FROM|TO|IS_DONE

delimiter is |, if it is not obvious enough
there is probably no need for keywords, since the delimiter should be good enough
to act as replacement for keywords. But screw whoever who ever decides to put | as 
part of their arguments.


Yay parsing done, now left with saving into the file. File corruption not handled, 
so if stupid shit like ||||||| got entered into the savefile, I am screwed. Will 
finish up saving into the savefile tomorrow. Should really find a time to refactor 
certain methods into other classes.

List of all methods so that life becomes easier for me.
Duke:
    greetUser()
    printLine()
    help()
    save()
    exit()
    parseUserInput()
    parseSaveFile()
    savefileChecker()
    main()
TaskList:
    isValidTaskNo()
    parseTasks()
    constructor Tasklist()
    constructor Tasklist(savefile)
    printAddTaskMessage()
    printDeleteTaskMessage()
    printBlankArgumentError()
    printMissingKeywordError()
    hasBlankArgument()
    hasMissingKeyword()
    addTodo()
    addDeadline()
    addEvent()
    listTasks()
    markDone()
    unmarkDone()
    deleteTask()
    saveToFile()
    findTask()
Task:
    constructor Task()
    getName()
    getTaskType()
    setStatus()
    isDone()
    toString()
    toSaveString()

Class Ui should implement:
    greetUser()
    printLine()
    help()
    All printing in tasklist.

Ui classes should be all completed. I made 2 separate ui classes, one for Duke
and one for TaskList, cos the tasklist Ui requires information from within tasklist
and I will need to type a lot more for certain functions. Too lazy to do that. The 
next in line will be savefile manager. How fun.
