# User Guide
Duke acts as a productivity task manager tool that keeps track of your tasks through the CLI. It comes with meaningful features such as data persistence through auto-saving and auto-loading of data.
However, please note that Duke is only suitable for single-user usage as it does not have any online database feature.
## Features
### Adding different types of tasks
User is able to enter 3 types of tasks : 
- ***todo*** : comprising a description string
- ***deadline*** : comprising a description string, and a deadline time.
- ***event*** : comprising a description string, a starting and ending time.

### Modifying and listing existing tasks

User can list all the existing tasks that they currently have so that they can decide whether they need to add, mark, unmark or delete any of the task.
Afterwards, user can then edit existing tasks in 3 ways :
- ***mark*** : marks the task as done
- ***unmark*** : undo the mark on the task (not done)
- ***delete*** : removes the corresponding task from the task list



### Data-persistence (auto-save)
Upon loading of the program, it will check for any existing file ```./data/duke.txt```.  If it exists, it will load the data from the file.
After every adding or modifying of the task, the new task will be automatically saved to the ```./data/duke.txt```. If the file or the directory does not exist, it will create the directory and the file. Afterwards, it will save the updated list of tasks onto the file.

## Usage

### Initialization
Upon loading the program, if the ```./data/duke.txt``` does not exist in user's local machine, it will be created :
```agsl
Directory does not exist, creating a directory called data...
Directory data has been successfully created
File does not exist, creating a new file ./data/duke.txt
File duke.txt has been successfully created
``` 
Afterwards, the user will be greeted with :
```
