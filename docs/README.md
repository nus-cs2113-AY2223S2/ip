## 3. FAQ <a name = "faq"></a>
Q: How do I transfer data from one machine to another machine?

A: The application can be moved by copying the ```.jar``` file from the original machine to the new machine. The save data from ```./data/araxys.txt``` can then be transferred to the same directory as the ```.jar``` file.
