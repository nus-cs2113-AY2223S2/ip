## Features

### Keep a List of Items

Keep forgetting your tasks? Have no fear, NakiriAyame will help you keep track of them!

### Flexible Inputs

You're free to specify your dates as a date, or as a string describing the conditions and long enough to summon a demon.

### Persistent Data

Your Tasks are stored in a text file after every action, so your data (unlike Ayame herself) is never lost!

### Filter easily!

NakiriAyame filters and returns your Tasks by any keyword in O(1)! (Trust me, I got A+ in CS2040C)
