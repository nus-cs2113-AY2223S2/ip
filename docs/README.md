#### 1. Add Todo

Use the command `todo [task name]` to add a new task to your list

example: `todo buy food`
```
added:  buy food
```
<br/><br/>
#### 2. Add Deadline

Use the command `Deadline [task name] /[due_date]` to add a new task to your list

```
Got it. I've added " buy milk "
with a deadline of: tuesday10pm
```
<br/><br/>
#### 3. Add Event

Use the command `event [task name] /start_time /end_time` to add a new task to your list

```
Got it. I've added " foodie cooking show "
with a start time of: wed3pm 
and an ending time of: wed5pm
```
<br/><br/>
#### 4. List tasks

Use the command `list` to list out all the tasks

Expected result:

2.[D][ ] buy milk  (by: tuesday10pm)
3.[E][ ] foodie cooking show (from: wed3pm  to: wed5pm)
There are currently 3 task(s) in the list
```

The letters "T" , "D" and "E" represent Todos, Deadlines and Events respectively.
The due dates, start and end times will also be shown next to the task name.
<br/><br/>
#### 5. Mark tasks

You can mark tasks as completed by using the `mark [task_number]` command.
The task number is the corresponding number of the task in the `list` output.

For example: `mark 2`
```
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[X]   buy milk
```
<br/><br/>
#### 6. Unmark tasks

You can unmark tasks as completed by using the `unmark [task_number]` command.
The task number is the corresponding number of the task in the `list` output.

For example: `unmark 2`
```
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[ ]    buy milk 
```
<br/><br/>
#### 7. Delete tasks

You can delete tasks as completed by using the `delete [task_number]` command.
The task number is the corresponding number of the task in the `list` output.

For example: `delete 2`
```
Noted. I've removed this task:
2.[D][ ] buy milk  (by: tuesday10pm)
```
<br/><br/>
#### 8. Search tasks

You can search for tasks that have a name that includes a keyword determined by the user.
This is done by using the `find` keyword.
For example:

For example: `find food`
```
There are 2 matching tasks in your list
1.[T][ ]buy food
2.[E][ ] foodie cooking show (from: wed3pm  to: wed5pm)
```

Tasks with names that include the keyword will be listed out, even if the keyword is a substring of a word in the name.
<br/><br/>
#### 9. Exiting Duke

You can exit the application using the `bye` command.

Upon exiting Duke, Duke will save the current tasks in the list to a local text file in your device.
These saved tasks will be imported into Duke when it is subsequently launched in the future,
ensuring that you do not lose track of you tasks.
