## Features

There are 3 types of tasks that you can add to your to-do list.

- todo (indicated by `[T]`)

- deadline (indicated by `[D]`)

- event (indicated by `[E]`)

### List tasks
You can list all the tasks in your to-do list.

### Mark/unmark tasks
You can mark tasks in your to-do list as done (indicated by `[X]`) or undone (indicated by `[ ]`).

### Delete tasks
You can delete tasks from your to-do list.

### Find tasks
You can find tasks in your to-do list that contain keywords of your choice.

### Local storage
Your to-do list is automatically saved into a file named `data.txt` on your local device. On start-up, Duke will load
your to-do list from the `data.txt` file if there is one.
