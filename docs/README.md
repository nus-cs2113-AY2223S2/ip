# Mom - User Guide
Similar to your real-life mom, Mom is a naggy remainder app that helps people to keep track of their todos, deadlines and events that they have! It uses a command-line interface, which make inputs swift and convenient! (Honestly, can't you remember it yourself?)

## Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 and above installed in your computer.
2. Download the ***ip.jar*** [here](https://github.com/pinyoko573/ip/releases)
3. Make sure that you do not have ***reminders.txt*** in the folder where *ip.jar* is located, as this file will be used to store the reminders!
4. Launch your command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder where *ip.jar* is located.
5. Run the following command: `java -jar ip.jar`

Note: **DO NOT** modify ***reminders.txt*** unless you know what you are doing!

## Features
### Keeps a list of reminders

Mom enables you to keep track a list of reminders and display it whenever you need it. (Why can't you do it yourself??)

### Flexible reminder inputs

With different types of reminders, you can specify a reminder with dateline, or a reminder with start & end date. (Better than calendars, right??)

### Marks reminder that are completed/uncompleted

You can mark reminders once you have completed them. (Good job?)

### Find specific reminder

With many reminders, Mom allows to search and retrieve the reminder that you are finding. (Similar to asking your mom to find your lost stuff at home, no?)

### Persistent data

Reminders are stored into a text file (reminders.txt) after each action is performed, so you don't need to key them again. (Aren't moms amazing?)
