	 Hello! I'm Vivy.
	 Here are some commands you can give me:
	 - list: I'll list out all the tasks you have recorded.
	 - mark <task_number>: I'll mark that task as done.
	 - unmark <task_number>: I'll mark that task as undone.
	 - bye: I will shut down my program.
	 - Anything else will be recorded as a task. 

	 Format for tasks:
	   Deadlines: <description> /by <deadline>
	              (eg. Eat bread /by Thursday)
	      Events: <description> /from <start date/time> /to <end date/time>
	              (eg. Meeting /from March 3 8pm /to 9pm)
	        Todo: <description>
	              (eg. Water the plants)
	 Wrong formats for Deadlines and Events will default to a Todo task. 

	 What can I do for you?
